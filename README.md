# Sectuqui

Sectuqui is the name we gave to the group chat with my summer friends. Where we spend the summer, there are a number of popular activities to do: going to the beach, going by boat and partying. 
You have to bear in mind that we were between 14 and 19 years old in the time I'm talking about in this analysis. I thought it would be cool to understand each of us shedules, favorite activities, and periods of time we talk to each other.

First of all you will find the option to check how our conversation evolves over time. You can already see three major points:
1. We mostly talk during the summer.
2. Over time, there is less interaction.
3. Looks like Ari's the one who talks the most, which makes sense because she's the band's glue.

The following visualizations reveal the busiest days of the week across individuals. It appears that Monday is one of the most popular days among the group while Saturday and Thursday is one of the least.

It's probably due to the fact that Tusday was one of the days off from the parting which leads us to have to make some alternative plans. The same thing happens on Saturday since we were already preparing to go out (except for Clara, she was always late and had to ask where we were).

The amount per word per message is mostly under 50, with really small exceptions that where plan explanations that either of us was shearing to make sure we were on the same page.

When it comes to the content we shared in the group chat, there is some difference which fits perfectly with our personalities:

Maria: She adjusts very quickly and cares to meet.

Adri: Like Maria, she wants to spend time together, preferably at the beach (Cana = Canadell is the name of the primary beach)

Alex: She mainly wants to relax in a boat and sunbathe.

Ari: she worries about making great deals, and her main proposals go either to the beach (Cana) or to the boat.

Me (Gemma): I especially want to go on the boat and sometimes I suggest plans but not very often.
