# Sectuqui

Sectuwhich is the name we gave to the group chat with my summer friends. Where we spend the summer, there are a number of popular activities to do: going to the beach, going by boat and partying. 
You have to bear in mind that we were between 14 and 19 years old in the time I'm talking about in this analysis. I thought it would be cool to understand each of us shedules, favorite activities, and periods of time we talk to each other.

First of all you will find the option to check how our conversation evolves over time. You can already see three major points:
1. We mostly talk during the summer.
2. Over time, there is less interaction.
3. Looks like Ari's the one who talks the most, which makes sense because she's the band's glue.
